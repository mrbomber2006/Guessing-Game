# Guessing-Game
This code is a number guessing game where one player (the "Challenger") tries to guess a randomly generated number between 0 and 99. Another player (the "Questioner") can also participate by entering the number instead of the bot. The Challenger has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number. 
Note: The code is written in Python and requires the colorama library for colored output.
pip install colorama
